 Phishing Email Analysis Report
1. Sample Email obtained

2. Sender's Email Address – Spoof Check
Suspicious:
Email address: account-security@amaz0n-billing.com

Spoofing Attempt: Uses a lookalike domain (amaz0n with a zero) instead of amazon.com.


3. Email Header Discrepancies (From Header Analysis)
 Header Flags Found (via analyzer):
SPF: fail – Sender IP not authorized to send emails for the domain

DKIM: fail – Digital signature verification failed

DMARC: fail – Domain policy not satisfied

Return-Path shows a Russian domain: phisher@compromised-mail.ru
  Conclusion: Email authentication completely fails.


4. Suspicious Links or Attachments
Attachment: Amazon_Account_Report.zip — Executable attachments in ZIP format are common malware vectors.
Link (hidden behind “Verify Now”) — URL is hidden, possibly redirecting to a fake login or phishing site.

5. Urgent or Threatening Language
Yes — phrases like:
"Urgent: Your Amazon Account Has Been Locked"
"Failure to do so within 24 hours will result in permanent suspension"
These are common social engineering tactics to pressure the user into acting quickly.

6. Mismatched or Masked URLs
Although the actual destination URL is not shown in the email body, phishing emails typically use a hyperlinked button ("Verify Now") to disguise malicious links. Hovering over the link would likely reveal a mismatched domain.

7. Spelling or Grammar Errors
The email text itself appears mostly grammatically correct, but the "Amazon Customer Protection" sign-off is not a legitimate department name, indicating inauthenticity.

8. Phishing Traits Found
Spoofed Email: The sender address amaz0n-billing.com mimics the legitimate domain amazon.com using a zero (0) instead of the letter "o" — a classic example of a lookalike domain used in phishing.

Header Failures: Email authentication checks failed — SPF, DKIM, and DMARC did not validate the message, indicating it likely did not come from a trusted source.

Threat Language: The email uses urgency and fear tactics like “account locked” and “permanent suspension within 24 hours” to pressure the recipient into immediate action.

Suspicious Attachment: The .zip file named Amazon_Account_Report.zip is highly suspicious, as compressed attachments are often used to deliver malware.

Fake Branding: The sign-off uses “Amazon Customer Protection,” which is not an actual department of Amazon, reducing the credibility of the message.

Hidden Link: The “🔗 Verify Now” link hides the real destination URL, which is a common trick used to redirect users to malicious or fake login pages.

Slight Authenticity: While the grammar and formatting are relatively clean, this is a tactic used by more sophisticated phishing emails to gain trust and bypass suspicion.
